This is my vocal stems web app.

This app allows you to enter a youtube link of a song from youtube, and outputs the isolated vocals in .wav format.
These isolated vocals are great for sampling in songs, any many other uses.
I created this app because I constantly found myself trying to locate the isolated vocals to songs so I can sample in my own tracks.
